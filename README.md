# Quiz bot
## A ERN Stack (Express - Reactjs - Nodejs) quiz app by Margot Rasamy.

P.S: As the quiz datas are linked to the backend API, it would be a little more complicated to deploy the whole project on Netlify.
Please, test the project on your local while lauching the backend server and the front project at the same time for a nice quiz experience.
