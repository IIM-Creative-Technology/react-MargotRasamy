# Quiz bot
## A ERN Stack (Express - Reactjs - Nodejs) quiz app by Margot Rasamy.

P.S: As the quiz datas are linked to the backend API, it would be a little more complicated to deploy the whole project on Netlify.
Please, test the project on your local while lauching the backend server and the front project at the same time for a nice quiz experience.

### Install the dependencies
```console
cd frontend && yarn install
```

```console
cd backend && npm install
```

### Launch the server

```console
cd backend && npm start
```

### See the website in your browser / In order to see the quiz, please launch the server, it is necessary.

```console
cd frontend && yarn start
```
